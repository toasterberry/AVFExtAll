# AVFExtAll

Fork of AVFExt that extracts multiple AVF files at once, rather than the original that only does 1 file at a time, very time consuming for extracting hundreds of AVF files. Very butchered code, idk how to code, but it somehow works.

# AVFExt

Converter for AVF files used in Her Interactive games (in particular the Nancy Drew series). Credit to Faye/ShimmerFairy for [oldhertools](https://gitlab.com/ShimmerFairy/oldhertools), which helped me figure out most of the format.
